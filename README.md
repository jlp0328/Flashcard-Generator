## Project Description:

This project utilizes Node.js to generate different types of flashcards: basic and cloze.

Basic flashcards, which have a front (“Who was the first president of the United States?”), and a back (“George Washington”).
Cloze flashcards, which present partial text (“… was the first president of the United States.”), and the full text when the user requests it (“George Washington was the first president of the United States.”)

## Technologies Used:

* Node.js
* Inquirer
